Text Replace
============

A python Text-Replacement command.
Allows you to submit a string to be sent to the current channel.
The string will will be compared against a dictionary of token/replacement strings.
Tokens appearing in the string will be replaced with a replacement string from the dictionary.

To autoload the script, place it in your Hexchat /Addons/ folder or your XChat profile folder.
This script stores text-replacement rules in a .txt file. 
The second file is named <Script Name>.txt and will be searched for in the same directory as the script.
Typically, it will be called "TextReplace.txt". It'll be autogenerated when you first successfully execute /TRA
That's assuming that the file can actually be written to.

The storage file format is simple:
Even lines are Keys/Tokens.
Odd lines are Values/Text Replacements.

Example:
[1]
!
[2]
@
>> /TR [1][2]3
>> !@3

Usage:

- Send a text-replaced message -
/TR <Message>
/TR Hello [Mars]
>> Hello World!

- Add a text-replacement rule -
/TRA <token> <replacement string>
/TRA [Mars] World!

- List text-replacement rules -
/TRL

- Reload text-replacement rules from file -
/TReload
